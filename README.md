**Discord Message Extractor**

This C++ script was designed to take files from a specific txt format (found in this video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eoM2-s3HxPc).
It will exclude messages, either from yourself or from the other user, so you can essentially view your own messages, or extract messages from the other person.

To make it work, place the Discord DM file in the same directory as this script, run the code in an IDE, and follow the prompts in the terminal.

This code is a basic side project, and some functions were adapted from a previous assignment related to Markov chaining. Do note that this work was done by
an amateur, so it will not follow basic C++ etiquette, haha.
